## Configuration
Before you can use the script with your cloud, you need a configuration file
in your home directory. Generate one with the setup wizard.
If you want your local backup somewhere other than *${HOME}/savegames* you also
must use the wizard to create a config file:
```bash
savegamesync -s [--setup]
```
## Usage
### Short Options
**Caution**: For every option exists a short option. If you want to use only short options following syntax is also okay:
```bash
savegamesync -bcdpg $Game1 $Game2
```
This copies the backup of the savegame to a local defined folder and uploads it to your cloud. It renames the old file on both destinations (Cloud and local). For more explanation only the long options are listed here.

## Howto add games
If you miss a game, which is not listed here, just fork the project, add the missing game to the *games.xml* and send an submit request. If you don't know where the savestate of your game is located, check-out [PCGamingWiki](https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home). Linux savegame location is most probably listed there.

Here is an example of a xml snippet containing a game
```xml
    <game name="$GamenameForTheScript">
        <parent>$Relative Path to the parent directory of the game</parent>
        <gamedir>savegame directory relative to the parent directory from above.</gamedir>
    </game>
```
